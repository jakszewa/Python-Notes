# What is Variable and how to use it

'''
Dos and don’ts
• Start the variable’s name with a letter.
• Any letter or number can be used in the name.
• Symbols such as -, /, #, or @ aren’t allowed.
• Spaces can’t be used.
• An underscore ( _ ) can be used instead of a space.
• Uppercase (capitals) and lowercase letters are different.
  Python will treat “Score” and “score” as two different variables.
• Avoid words Python uses as commands, such as “print”.
